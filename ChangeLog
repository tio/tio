=== tio v1.38 ===



Changes since tio v1.37:

 * Redirect error messages to stderr

 * Improve help and man page

 * Fix running without config file

 * Fix config file error messages

 * Redirect error messages to stderr

 * Add repology packaging status

 * Fix parsing of default settings

   Default configuration file settings were not parsed in case a section
   was matched. Now we make sure that the default (unnamed) settings are
   always parsed.

 * Append to existing log file (no truncation)

 * Add socket info to show configuration

 * Print socket info at startup

 * Fix socket option parsing

Peter Collingbourne:

 * Match user input against config section names if pattern matching was unsuccessful.

   This allows for better config file ergonomics if the user has a diverse
   set of serial devices as the name does not need to be specified in
   the config file twice.

 * Add support for external control via a Unix domain socket.

   This feature allows an external program to inject output into and
   listen to input from a serial port via a Unix domain socket (path
   specified via the -S/--socket command line flag, or the socket
   config file option) while tio is running. This is useful for ad-hoc
   scripting of serial port interactions while still permitting manual
   control. Since many serial devices (at least on Linux) get confused
   when opened by multiple processes, and most commands do not know
   how to correctly open a serial device, this allows a more convenient
   usage model than directly writing to the device node from an external
   program.

   Any input from clients connected to the socket is sent on the serial
   port as if entered at the terminal where tio is running (except that
   ctrl-t sequences are not recognized), and any input from the serial
   port is multiplexed to the terminal and all connected clients.

   Sockets remain open while the serial port is disconnected, and writes
   will block.

   Example usage 1 (issue a command):

     echo command | nc -UN /path/to/socket > /dev/null

   Example usage 2 (use the expect command to script an interaction):

     #!/usr/bin/expect -f

     set timeout -1
     log_user 0

     spawn nc -UN /path/to/socket
     set uart $spawn_id

     send -i $uart "command1\n"
     expect -i $uart "prompt> "
     send -i $uart "command2\n"
     expect -i $uart "prompt> "

lexaone:

 * fix for using option 'log' without 'log-filename' in config file



Changes since tio v1.36:

 * Make libinih a fallback dependency

   This means that in case meson does not find libinih it will
   automatically clone libinih and include it in the build.

   The libinih library is reconfigured to be statically built so that no
   shared object will be installed.

Sylvain LAFRASSE:

 * Fix timestamp parsing in INI conf

 * Factorize timestamp parsing to be coherent with command line format in configuration file.



Changes since tio v1.35:

 * Add support for defaults in config file

   If no section name is specified the configuration will be considered the
   default one.

   This allows to set e.g. a default color code for sections which do not
   configure a color code.

 * Handle SIGHUP

   Handle SIGHUP so that the registered exit handlers are called to restore
   the terminal back to its orignal state.

 * Add color configuration support

 * Bypass unused result warnings

 * Force dependency on libinih

   Configuration file support is considered a mandatory feature.

 * Update headers

 * Update AUTHORS

 * Update man page

 * Move string_to_long() to misc.c

 * Update CircleCI config

 * Update tio gif

 * Update README

 * Update LICENSE date

 * Remove redundant COPYING file

Liam Beguin:

 * Document configuration file options

 * Add support for a configuration file

 * misc: add _unused macro

   Some parameters are expected to be unused.
   Add a basic macro to mute these compiler warnings.

 * options: expose string_to_long()

   Expose string_to_long() so that other source files can use it.



Changes since tio v1.34:

 * Add support for automatically generated log filename

   Automatically generate log filename if none is provided.

   The auto generated file name is on the form:
   "tio_DEVICE_YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.log"

 * Add support for configurable timestamp format

   Also changes default timestamp format from ISO8601 to classic 24-hour
   format as this is assumed to be the format that most users would prefer.

   And reintroduces strict but optional ISO8601 format.

   This feature allows to easily add more timestamp formats in the future.

 * Reintroduce asm-generic/ioctls.h

   It is needed for ppc builds.

 * Add macro hack to workaround older buggy glibc

Robey Pointer:

 * Add support for high bps on OS X



Changes since tio v1.33:

 * Fix setspeed2 compilation

 * Only apply color formatting when using color option

   To help the color blind who may use custom terminal foreground /
   background colors.

 * Update README

 * Add '-c, --color' option

   Allow user to select which ANSI color code to use to colorize the tio
   text. To successfully set the color the color code must be in the range
   0..255.

   If color code is negative tio will print all available ANSI colors.

   The default color is changed to bold white to make tio defaults usable
   for most users, including color blind users.

 * Fix setspeed2 check

 * Fix meson header check string

 * Reintroduce long timestamp format

   But make the timestamp format RFC3339 compliant instead. The RFC states:

   NOTE: ISO 8601 defines date and time separated by "T".
         Applications using this syntax may choose, for the sake of
         readability, to specify a full-date and full-time separated by
         (say) a space character.

   This way we keep the information specified by ISO 8601 but make it more
   human readable which is better for the console output.

 * Update version year

Sylvain LAFRASSE:

 * Fix TTY device listing on Darwin. (#136)

 * Fix TCGETS2 search on Darwin.



Changes since tio v1.32:

 * Show auto connect status in show configuration

 * Use '#pragma once' in all headers

 * Improve printed output

   Get rid of inconsistencies in the printed output (error printing,
   colors, etc.).

   Prepare for user configurable color.

 * Rename option -i to -L

 * Shorten timestamp
 
 * Shorten timestamp description

   We do not need the date part of the timestamp. It simply takes up too
   much precious line space. In case of logging to file, one can easily
   conclude the date from the file date information.

 * Replace Travis with circleCI

 * Replace autotools with meson

   To introduce much simpler build configuration which is also easier to
   maintain.

 * Add list serial devices feature

   For convenience, add a --list-devices option which lists the available
   serial devices.

 * Cleanup: Use dot notation for default options struct

 * Update AUTHORS

 * Add command to show version

   The key sequence ctrl-t v will now show the version of tio.

 * Align format of timestamps
 
 * Add Sylvain as official co-maintainer

Sylvain LAFRASSE:

 * Add '-t' option description for time stamping.

 * Add description for time stamping.

 * Resolved tio/tio#84: Added timestamps in log file if enabled.

attila-v:

 * Refine timestamps with milliseconds and ISO-8601 format (#129).

   * Show milliseconds too in the timestamp (#114) and log file (#124)
   * Change timestamp format to ISO-8601.

Yin Fengwei:

 * Output newline on stdout with hex print mode

   This is to fix the issue #104. The timestamp will always be
   printed at the beginning of line:

   [10:25:56] Switched to hexadecimal mode
   0d 0a 0d [10:25:57] 41 43 52 4e 3a 5c 3e 0d 0a 0d [10:25:58] 41

   is changed to:

   [12:34:56] 45 72 72 6f 72 3a 20 49 6e 76 61 6c 69 64 20
   [12:34:56] 41 43 52 4e 3a 5c 3e
   [12:34:56] 41 43 52 4e 3a 5c 3e
   [12:34:57] 41 43 52 4e 3a 5c 3e 6c 73

Jakob Haufe:

 * Make comparison POSIX compliant

   String comparison with == is not POSIX compliant and can fail with e.g.
   dash.

Henrik Brix Andersen:

 * Add bash completion of tty devices.

 * Add -t/--timestamp to bash completion script.

Henner Zeller:

 * Local echo: show character by character even if stdout buffered.

Björn Stenberg:

 * Show error when failing to open a tty

Alban Bedel:

 * Fix out of tree builds

   Out of tree builds are currently broken because $(top_srcdir)src/include
   is not in the search path. In tree builds are working because autconf add
   $(top_builddir)/src/include to the search path for the generated config.h.
   As $(top_builddir) and $(top_srcdir) are identical during in tree builds
   the search path still end up beeing somehow correct.

   To fix this add -I$(srcdir)/include to the CPPFLAGS in Makefile.am.

Fabrice Fontaine:

 * src/setspeed2.c: fix redefinition of termio

   Include ioctls.h and termbits.h from asm-generic instead of asm to avoid
   build failures.

Erik Moqvist

 * Exit if output speed cannot be set.

Lars Kellogg-Stedman:

 * fflush() after putchar() for print_hex and print_normal

   In order for local echo to work properly, we have to either call
   fflush(stdout) after every character or just disable line buffering.
   This change calls fflush() after putchar().

 * Disable line buffering in stdout

   In order for local echo to work properly, we have to either call
   fflush(stdout) after every character or just disable line buffering.
   This change uses setbuf(stdout, NULL) to do the latter.

George Stark:

 * dont show line state if ioctl failed

 * add serial lines manual control

arichi:

 * Flush every local echo char

   Flush stdout at every char in case it
   happens to be buffered.

Mariusz Midor:

 * Newline: handle booth NL and CR

   Flag ONLCRNL expects code \n after press Enter, but on some systems \r is send instead.



Changes since tio v1.31:

 * Update AUTHORS

 * Minor code style cleanups

 * Cleanup print macros

 * Flush output

   Make sure output is transmitted immediately by flushing the output.

Robey Pointer:

 * add optional timestamps

   with "-t" or "C-t T", toggle a timestamp prefix to each line.

Jakub Wilk:

 * Fix typos

Sylvain Lafrasse:

 * Added macOS compatibility

 * Made O_NONBLOCK flag to open() call specific to macOS only.

 * Added macOS-related details.

 * Added O_NONBLOCK flag to open() call for macOS (10.13.6) compatibility.



Changes since tio v1.30:

 * Update date

 * Update AUTHORS

Henner Zeller:

 * Clarify the input/output variable names (No-op change)

 * Organize options the same sequence they are mentioned in cmdline help.

 * Update README.

 * Map CR->NL locally on output instead of using tio.c_oflag |= OCRNL.

   This mostly is intended to have local echo output exactly what is sent
   to the remote endpoint.
   A nice side-effect is, that it also fixes tty-implementations, that can't
   deal with the OCRNL flag on tio.c_oflag.

 * Provide local-echo option.

   Can be switched on with -e on the command line.
   Can be toggled with Ctrl t e while program is running.

 * Write to logfile as soon as we have the data, don't buffer.

   Logfiles are important to see what happened, in particular if something
   unexpected happened; so we want to make sure that the logfile is flushed
   to disk.

   Before this change, the logfile was typically written at the end in
   a large chunk as the default (large) buffering applied. Now, characters are
   written out ASAP, so it is possible to get a live-view with a
   tail -f <logfile>



Changes since tio v1.29:

 * Update README

 * Update man page and bash completion

 * Update AUTHORS

qianfan Zhao:

 * ONLCRNL: change the method to map NL to CR-NL



Changes since tio v1.28:

 * Add mapping flags INLCRNL and ODELBS

   The following new mapping flags are added:

   INLCRNL: Map NL to CR-NL on input.
   ODELBS: Map DEL to BS on output.

   Flags requested and tested by Jan Ciger (janoc).



Changes since tio v1.27:

 * Update README

 * Update AUTHORS

 * Add snap status to README.md

 * Add README.md to prettify GitHub page

 * Add missing header

Petr Vaněk:

 * Add missing header file under musl-libc

   Musl's inclusion tree slightly differs from glibc, therefore TCGETS2 is
   not reachable through sys/ioctl.h, so asm/ioctls.h needs to be included
   too.

Jakub Wilk:

 * Fix grammar and typos



Changes since tio v1.26:

 * Update man page

 * Add support for setting non-standard baudrates

   Support for non-standard baudrate settings will be automatically enabled
   if the termios2 interface is detected available. However, to play it
   safe, the old and widely supported termios interface will still be used
   when setting standard baudrates.

 * Cleanup

 * Update AUTHORS



Changes since tio v1.25:

 * Reconfigure stdin

   Make stdin behave more raw'ish. In particular, don't
   translate CR -> NL on input.

 * Add special character map feature

   Add a --map option which allows mapping special characters, in particular CR and
   NL characters which are used in various combinations on various platforms.

 * Cleanup

 * Update AUTHORS

 * Update README

 * Mention website

 * Update man page



Changes since tio v1.24:

 * Fix error applying new stdout settings

   On Fedora 26 tio will quit with the following error message:

   "Error: Could not apply new stdout settings (Invalid argument)"

   In case of Fedora, it turns out that the new stdout settings used are a
   bit too aggressive because an empty termios structure is used. To remedy
   this we reuse the existing stdout settings and only reconfigure the
   specific options we need to make a "raw" stdout configuration.

 * Remove unused pkgconfig in configure

 * Code cleanup

   Remove unused variable.



Changes since tio v1.23:

 * Optimize clear screen command

   Replaced system call with inline ANSI/VT100 clear screen code sequence

 * Fix bash completion installation

   Fixed the configure script to avoid that the bash completion script gets
   installed outside of the prefix location. The default install location
   is now $prefix/share/bash-completion/completions.

   Use the configure option '--with-bash-completion-dir=PATH' if you need
   to install the bash completion script elsewhere.

Jakub Wilk:

 * Add missing commas in conditional sentences



Changes since tio v1.22:

 * Update copyright headers

Jakub Wilk:

 * Fix typos



Changes since tio v1.21:

 * Update man page date

 * Update copyright year

 * Code cleanup

 * Update README and man page



Changes since tio v1.20:

 * Add support for hexadecimal mode

   A new key command 'ctrl-t h' is introduced which toggles between
   hexadecimal mode and normal mode. When in hexadecimal mode data received
   will be printed in hexadecimal.

 * Do not distribute src/bash_completion/tio

   Since the bash completion tio script is now autogenerated from tio.in it
   should not be distributed in the tarball.

 * Add missing forward flag

 * Update AUTHORS file

Adam Borowski:

 * 'ctrl-t b' to send serial break.

Jakub Wilk:

 * Removed git commit references from ChangeLog

   ChangeLog is primary useful for users who don't have the git repository
   at hand.

   Replace git commit references with version numbers; or if the change
   only cleans up another change with no release in between, remove the
   changelog item completely.



Changes since tio v1.19:

 * Added more error handling of terminal calls

   Also removed duplicate terminal flushing calls.

 * Revert "Added support for non-standard baud rates"

   This reverts a change made in v1.18.

   Reverting because supporting non-standard or arbitrary baud rates is
   troublesome because the c library provides no means of doing so and even
   if bare metal linux kernel interface is used it will not work on all
   Linux kernels version.



Changes since tio v1.18:

 * Rearranged key commands

   Rearranged the key commands:

   ctrl-t c (clear screen) is now
   ctrl-t l which is similar to the well known shell ctrl-l

   ctrl-t i (show settings information) is now
   ctrl-t c (show configuration)

   Updated man page accordingly.

 * Added "ctrl-t c" key command to clear screen



Changes since tio v1.17:

 * Updated man page

 * Added support for non-standard baud rates

   Only enabled when possible, that is, when the BOTHER definition is
   available.

   It is untested but it should work as described here:
   https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=683826

   Some Cypress USB<->serial devices supposedly supports arbitrary speeds.

 * Generate baudrate switch cases based on detection

   Support a single source of baud rate configuration as discussed in
   https://github.com/tio/tio/issues/45 .

   To do so, autogeneration of the switch cases which do the baud rate
   option value check and configuration/conversion in tty_configure() is
   introduced via a single macro.

   Just to be safe, this change also enables configure detection of all
   baud rates, including the ones previously assumed supported by most/all
   systems (POSIX).

 * Minor cleanup

 * Exit when not a tty device in autoconnect mode

Jakub Wilk:

 * Added non-standard baud rates that are defined on FreeBSD

 * Capitalized "GitHub" in README



Changes since tio v1.16:

 * Compacted tty_configure() a bit

 * Fixed automatic baud rate enablement

 * Minor cleanups

 * Added autodetection of available baud rates

   Various platforms support different baud rates.

   To avoid adding platform specific handling generic baud rate detection
   tests are introduced in the configure script. Successfully detected baud
   rates are automatically enabled. This applies to both the C code and the
   bash completion script.

   Note:
   Baud rates below 57600 are defined by POSIX-1 and supported by most
   platforms so only baud rate 57600 and above are tested.

 * Updated bash-completion

 * Fixed printf() format type

 * Added Travis build configuration

Jakub Wilk:

 * Generated bash completion at configure time

 * Reduce code duplication in baud rate detection

 * Add support for baud rates 200 and 1800

 * Fixed baudrate type



Changes since tio v1.15:

 * Updated man page

 * Updated README

 * Removed obsolete packaging files

 * Removed use of deprecated bzero()



Changes since tio v1.14:

 * Removed + to remove potential confusion

 * Added input digit checks

 * Fixed license string

 * Introduced tty_configure()

   Moved tty configuration actions to tty_configure() in tty.c. This way
   options.c is strictly about parsing options nothing else.

 * Function names cleanup

 * Updated AUTHORS file

   Added Nick who created the new tio package for Arch Linux.

 * Fixed tx/rx counters type

Jakob Haufe:

 * Include config.h before standard headers

   Large file support was meant to be enabled in v1.11.
   This change enables it for real.



Changes since tio v1.13:

 * Fixed tio_printf macro

 * Fixed launch hints

   Fixed launch hints not being printed in no autoconnect mode.

 * Added 'ctrl-t ?' to list available commands

 * Fixed log mechanism

   To avoid echoing only log what is received from tty device.

 * Improved tio output

   Added titles and indentation to commands output for clearer separation
   when firing commands repeatedly.

   Also added print of tio version and quit command hint at launch.

 * Cleaned up tio print mechanism

Jakub Wilk:

 * Fixed grammar

   "allow" is a transitive verb, which requires an object,
   so "allow to <verb>" is ungrammatical.

 * Fixed typo



Changes since tio v1.12:

 * Fixed some error prints

 * Fixed error printing for no autoconnect mode

   Always print errors but only print silent errors when in no autoconnect
   mode.

 * Added key command for showing session settings

   A new key command "ctrl-t i" is added to allow the user to display the
   various session settings information (baudrate, databits, log file, etc.).

   This is useful in case you have a running session but have forgotten
   what the settings are.



Changes since tio v1.11:

 * Consolidated command key handling

 * Moved delay mechanism into separate function

 * Retired obsolete usleep()

   Replaced with nanosleep()

 * Added simple tx/rx statistics command (ctrl-t s)

   To display the total number of bytes transmitted/received simply perform the
   'ctrl-t s' command sequence.

   This feature can be useful when eg. trying to detect non-printable
   characters.

 * Further simplification of key handling

   Changed so that the "ctrl-t ctrl-t" sequence is now simply "ctrl-t t" to
   send the ctrl-t key code. This is inspired by screen which does similar
   to send its command key code (ctrl-a a).

   This change also eases adding new key commands if needed.

   Updated man page accordingly.

 * Cleaned up and simplified key handling

Jakub Wilk:

 * Insert output delay only if something was output



Changes since tio v1.10:

 * Enabled large file support (LFS)

   Added autotools AC_SYS_LARGEFILE to support 64 bit file size handling.

 * Updated tio title



Changes since tio v1.9:

 * Introduced lock on device file

   Tio will now test for and obtain an advisory lock on the tty device file
   to prevent starting multiple sessions on the same tty device.

 * Updated AUTHORS

Jakub Wilk:

 * Treat EOF on stdin as error



Changes since tio v1.8:

 * Cleanup of error handling

   Introduced consistent way of handling errors and printing error messages.

   Also upgraded some warnings to errors.

 * Updated localtime() error message

 * Cleanup

Jakub Wilk:

 * Fix error handling for select()

   Previously the error handling code for select() was unreachable.

 * Removed unneeded quotes from AM_CFLAGS

 * Expanded tabs

 * Fixed setting "tainted"

   Set "tainted" if and only if any character was read from the device.

   Ctrl-t is no longer sent to the device on exit, so the trick to avoid
   its echo is not necessary.

   Characters read from stdin don't directly affect output, so they
   shouldn't enable "tainted".

 * Used \r in color_printf()

   \033[300D is an unusual way to move the cursor back to column 1.
   Use straightforward \r instead.

 * Added missing \r\n to warning messages

   \n alone is not enough, because the terminal is in raw mode.



Changes since tio v1.7:

 * Fixed enablement of compiler warnings

 * Fixed log_open() prototype

 * Fixed index error wrt ctrl-t detection

 * Fixed handling of ctrl-t

   Before, when exercising the quit key sequence (ctrl-t + q) the ctrl-t code
   (0x14) would be sent.

   This is now fixed so that it is not sent.

   However, in case it is needed to send ctrl-t to the device it is possible by
   simply repeating the ctrl-t.

   Meaning, ctrl-t + ctrl-t = ctrl-t sent to device.

 * Improved error handling

   Fixes a memory leak and avoids aggressive busy looping when problems
   accessing tty device.

 * Removed redundant log_close() call

 * Enabled compiler warnings

Jakub Wilk:

 * Stopped copying arguments to fixed-size buffers

   Don't needlessly copy command-line arguments into fixed-size buffers.

   Previously the program crashed if an overlong pathname was provided on
   the command line. Also, some systems (such as GNU Hurd) don't define
   MAXPATHLEN at all.

 * Added const to log_open() prototype

 * Completed the ^g to ^t transition

   In v1.7 the escape key was changed from ^g to ^t, but some
   code and comments still referred to the old key.

 * Used HTTPS for tio.github.io

 * Man page beautification

 * Bumped date in man page

 * Improve man page formatting

   Use regular font for metacharacters such as "[]", "," or "|";
   use italic font for metavariables.

 * Fixed hyphen vs minus vs em-dash confusion in man page

   - prints as hyphen;
   \- prints as minus sign;
   \em prints as em-dash.



Changes since tio v1.6:

 * Changed escape key from ^g to ^t

   After renaming to "tio" it makes sense to change the escape key
   accordingly. Hence, the new escape key is ^t.

   Meaning, in session, its now ctrl-t + q to quit.

Jakub Wilk:

 * Fixed silly "tio or tio" in man page

 * Fixed typo
