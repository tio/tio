=== Go TTY - The Really Simple TTY Terminal Application ===


1. Introduction

    Go TTY or "gotty" is a really simple TTY terminal application which
    features a simple commandline interface to easily connect to TTY devices
    for basic input/output.

    Go TTY was created because the author needed a simple no-nonsense TTY
    terminal application to go do quick debugging.

2. Usage

    The commandline interface is straightforward as reflected in the output
    from 'gotty --help':


        Usage: gotty [<options>] <tty device>

        Options:
          -b, --baudrate <bps>        Baud rate (default: 115200)
          -d, --databits 5|6|7|8      Data bits (default: 8)
          -f, --flow hard|soft|none   Flow control (default: none)
          -s, --stopbits 1|2          Stop bits (default: 1)
          -p, --parity even|odd|none  Parity (default: none)
          -o, --output-delay <ms>     Output delay (default: 0)
          -n, --no-autoconnect        Disable automatic connect
          -v, --version               Display version
          -h, --help                  Display help

        In session, press ctrl-g + ctrl-q to quit.


    The only option which requires a bit of elaboration is the --no-autoconnect
    option.

    By default gotty automatically connects to the provided device if present.
    If the device is not present it will wait for it to appear and then
    connect. If the connection is lost (eg. device disconnects) it will wait
    for the device to reappear and then reconnect.

    However, if the --no-autoconnect option is provided gotty will exit if the
    device is not present or exit if an established connection is lost.

    Go TTY features full bash autocompletion support.
