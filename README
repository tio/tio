=== tio - a simple TTY terminal I/O application ===


1. Introduction

    tio is a simple TTY terminal application which features a straightforward
    commandline interface to easily connect to TTY devices for basic
    input/output.

    It was created because the author needed a simple no-nonsense TTY terminal
    application to easily connect to various terminal TTY devices.


2. Usage

    The commandline interface is straightforward as reflected in the output
    from 'tio --help':


        Usage: tio [<options>] <tty device>

        Options:
          -b, --baudrate <bps>        Baud rate (default: 115200)
          -d, --databits 5|6|7|8      Data bits (default: 8)
          -f, --flow hard|soft|none   Flow control (default: none)
          -s, --stopbits 1|2          Stop bits (default: 1)
          -p, --parity even|odd|none  Parity (default: none)
          -o, --output-delay <ms>     Output delay (default: 0)
          -n, --no-autoconnect        Disable automatic connect
          -l, --log <filename>        Log to file
          -m, --map <flags>           Map special characters
          -v, --version               Display version
          -h, --help                  Display help

        In session, press ctrl-t q to quit.


    The only option which requires a bit of elaboration is perhaps the
    --no-autoconnect option.

    By default tio automatically connects to the provided device if present.
    If the device is not present, it will wait for it to appear and then
    connect. If the connection is lost (eg. device is unplugged), it will wait
    for the device to reappear and then reconnect. However, if the
    --no-autoconnect option is provided, tio will exit if the device is not
    present or an established connection is lost.

    Tio features full bash autocompletion support.

    Tio also supports various key commands. Press ctrl-t ? to list the
    available key commands.

    See the tio man page for more details.
